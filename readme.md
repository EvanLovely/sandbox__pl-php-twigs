## All the ways you can set up Pattern Lab PHP using Twig

This repo shows a few different ways to set it up, pick which one you want to use, then go to it's folder to read the readme and run the `setup.sh`.

1. `edition-php-twig-standard` - the official repo
2. `shila-pl` - Aleksi's fork of the above official repo
3. `shila-drupal-theme` - Aleksi's Drupal theme that uses the above

For a Pattern Lab PHP Twig install used in Drupal, I currently recommend option 2 if you have your own theme, or option 3 if you don't.
